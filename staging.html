        <p>In a city of millions, Liz and Eli met at a friend's birthday party (Thanks, Julia!). Liz was leaving for a 3-month adventure
          around Europe and Eli was dreaming about an "Around the World" plane ticket with his brother. Although they didn't meet again
          for 2 years, they left lasting impressions on each other.</p>

        <p>During an intense winter blizzard, Liz and Eli found themselves alone in New York without friends or family. They went to see a
          movie, spent the entire night talking about life and travel, and something beautiful - their relationship - began to take form.</p>

        <p>Fast forward to today: they travel the world and continue to fall in love with each other.</p>

        <p>On August 20th, they invite you to celebrate their wedding in one of the first places they traveled to together - Iceland.</p>

            <div class="content-the-hotel content">
              <p>We've chosen the amazing <a href="http://www.hotelbudir.is/">Hotel Budir</a> as the homebase for all our wedding events. This is where the chartered bus will pick-up and drop-off our guests. A set of rooms have been reserved for our guests.</p>
              <p>The rooms at Hotel Budir come in various sizes and with different amentities, so please make a request if you have specific needs. Breakfast is included with the rooms. Descriptions and prices can be found <a href="http://www.hotelbudir.is/TheHotel/Therooms/">here</a>.</p>
              <p>August is the high season in Iceland, therefore availability will be limited everywhere, but if you'd like to stay at a nearby hotel or airbnb, remember that you will need your own car to get to the hotel and to the wedding ceremony.  There is no taxi service in remote Iceland.</p>

              <p>We trust everyone will be stylish, but aim for "semiformal/dressy casual" - leave your jeans and sneakers behind. Similarly, no ballgowns required.</p><p> Our advice pertains mostly to the environment. There will be a fair amount of being out in nature, so dress accordingly. Bring a jacket and avoid sinking heels.</p>
              <p>The average daytime temperature around the coast during August is 10-12&deg;C (50-55&deg;F). A warm summer day would have temperatures around 20&deg;C (68&deg;F).</p>
              <p>The reception will be back at the hotel, so you will have a chance to change or slip on those dancing shoes.</p>

            <span class="answer">We value travel and new experiences above all else. Rather than ask for new physical possesions, we are asking that you donate to our honeymoon costs.  You can use a credit card on this site, or mail a check to our home. The address is listed in the registry section.</span>

            <span class="question">What is Iceland's weather like?</span>
            <span class="answer">August is the best time to visit Iceland, but it can be unpredictable. Random rain showers and cold breezes may occurr.  If you go on a glacier tour, you'll encounter some pretty cold weather.  Bring a light jack that is water resistant and you should be fine.</span>
