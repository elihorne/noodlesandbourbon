      <p>In a city of millions, Liz and Eli met at a friend's birthday party (Thanks, Julia!). Liz was leaving for a 3-month adventure
        around Europe and Eli was dreaming about an "Around the World" plane ticket with his brother. Although they didn't meet again
        for 2 years, they left lasting impressions on each other.</p>

      <p>During an intense winter blizzard, Liz and Eli found themselves alone in New York without friends or family. They went to see a
        movie, spent the entire night talking about life and travel, and something beautiful - their relationship - began to take form.</p>

      <p>Fast forward to today: they travel the world together, and continue to fall in love with each other.</p>

      <p>On August 20th, they invite you to celebrate their wedding in one of the first places they traveled to together - Iceland.</p>

      <ul class="faq-list">
        <li>
          <span class="question">Why Iceland?</span>
          <span class="answer">Iceland is one of the first places Liz and Eli traveled to together. When thinking about the best place to get married, Iceland was a natural choice.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="question">How does the registry work?</span>
          <span class="answer">We value travel and new experiences above all else. Rather than ask for new physical possesions, we are asking that you donate to our honeymoon costs.  You can use a credit card on this site, or mail a check to our home. The address is listed in the registry section.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="question">What is Iceland's weather like?</span>
          <span class="answer">August is the best time to visit Iceland, but it can be unpredictable. Random rain showers and cold breezes may occurr.  If you go on a glacier tour, you'll encounter some pretty cold weather.  Bring a light jack that is water resistant and you should be fine.</span>
