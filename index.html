        <p>In a city of millions, Liz and Eli met at a friend's birthday party (Thanks, Julia!). Liz was leaving for a 3-month adventure around Europe and Eli was dreaming about an "Around the World" plane ticket with his brother. Although they didn't meet again for 2 years, they left lasting impressions on each other.</p>
        <p>During an intense winter blizzard, Liz and Eli found themselves alone in New York without friends or family. They went to see a movie, spent the entire night talking about life and travel, and something beautiful &mdash; their relationship &mdash; began to take form.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to today: they travel the world and continue to fall in love with each other.</p>
        <p>On August 20th, they invite you to celebrate their wedding in one of the first places they visited together &mdash; Iceland.</p>

            <div class="content-the-hotel content">
              <p>We've chosen the amazing <a href="http://www.hotelbudir.is/">Hotel Budir</a> as the homebase for all our wedding events. This is where the chartered bus will pick-up and drop-off our guests. A set of rooms have been reserved for our guests.</p>
              <p>The rooms at Hotel Budir come in various sizes and with different amentities, so please make a request if you have specific needs. Breakfast is included with the rooms. Descriptions and prices can be found <a href="http://www.hotelbudir.is/TheHotel/Therooms/">here</a>. Links to book rooms can be found after RSVPing.</p>
              <p>August is the high season in Iceland, therefore availability will be limited everywhere, but if you'd like to stay at a nearby hotel or airbnb, remember that you will need your own car to get to the hotel and to the wedding ceremony. There
                is no taxi service in remote Iceland.</p>

              <p>We trust everyone will be stylish.</p>

              <p>We will be traveling on a bus to the wedding ceremony - which will be taking place outside on a black sand beach. After that, we will be making stops along the way back to the hotel. We will be outside! That said ladies, wear flat-heeled shoes and bring a jacket.</p>

              <p>The average daytime temperature around the coast during August is 10-12&deg;C (50-55&deg;F). A warm summer day would have temperatures around 20&deg;C (68&deg;F).</p>

              <p>The reception will be back at the hotel, aim for "semiformal/dressy casual". It will be cozy, comfortable and not sandy inside, so feel free to drop off your jackets in your room and bust out those dancing shoes.</p>

            <span class="question">Why Iceland?</span>
            <span class="answer">It's one of the first places outside of New York that Liz and Eli visited together. When thinking about the best places in the world to get married, Iceland was a natural choice.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="question">What is Iceland's weather like?</span>
            <span class="answer">August is the best time to visit the island, but be prepared for random showers and a sometimes chilly breeze. If you go on a glacier tour, brace yourself for a touch of winter, but with a light water resistant jacket and a little layering, you should be fine.</span>
